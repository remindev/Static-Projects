            A transistor consists of two PN diodes connected back to back. 
            It has three terminals namely emitter, base and collector. 
            The basic idea behind a transistor is that it lets you control the flow of current through

            <h3>Terminals of Transistor</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            As discussed in the previous section, a transistor is composed of three terminals: emitter, collector, and base. 
            In this section, we discuss the functionalities of each terminal in detail.
            <br><br>
            The base serves as a gate controller device for a larger electric supply. 
            The collector is a larger electrical supply and the outlet of that supply is the emitter. 
            The current flowing through the gate from the collector can be regulated by sending varying 
            levels of current from the base. In this manner, a very small amount of current can be used to 
            control a large amount of current like in amplifiers. Transistor works as a switch or as an amplifier.

            Physical Characteristics of Terminals
            <ul>
                <li>Emitter – This segment is on the left side of the transistor. It is moderately sized and heavily doped.</li>
                <li>Base – This segment is at the center of the transistor. It is thin and lightly doped.</li>
                <li>Collector – This segment is on the right side of the transistor. It is larger than the emitter and is moderately doped.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Base-emitter junction is forward biased</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            – There is a flow of electrons (holes) from the emitter to base and holes (electrons)from the base to emitter; however since the concentration of emitter electrons (holes) are greater than the base holes (electrons), this current is primarily made of electrons (holes)
            <br>
            – These emitter electrons (holes) become minority carriers in the base; however, since the base is narrow very little electron-hole recombination occurs in the base and these electrons (holes) are drawn towards the collector-base junction

            When these emitter electrons (holes) reach the collector-base junction, they are pulled across the junction into the collector by the electric field due to the depletion region ions.

            <h2>Different Types of Transistors and their Applications</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            There are many types of transistors and each transistor specializes in its application. 
            But, the main classification of transistors is as follows:

            <h3>Bipolar Junction Transistor</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            A bipolar junction transistor, shortly termed as BJT is a current controlled device that consists of two PN junction 
            for its function. It is configured in two ways as NPN and PNP. Among the two, NPN transistor is the most preferred 
            for the sake of convenience. The NPN transistor is made by placing a p-type material between two n-type materials. 
            Likewise, the PNP transistor is made by placing an n-type material between two p-type materials.

        <div class="title-cont">
            <h3>Field Effect Transistor</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            A field-effect transistor shortly termed as FET is a voltage-controlled device, 
            unlike BJT which is a current controlled device. The FET is a unipolar device, 
            which means that it is made using either p-type or n-type material as the main substrate. 
            One of the many of its advantages is that it has a very high input impedance, which is in the order of Mega Ohms. 
            It has many other advantages such as low heat dissipation and low power consumption.

            <h3>Transistor as an Amplifier and a Switch</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Transistor as an amplifier serves as an energy booster. 
            It comes in useful things like hearing aids, which is one of the prior gadgets people use for a transistor. 
            Hearing aids consist of a tiny microphone that picks up sounds for your world and converts them into varying electric currents. 
            Microphones are also fed into a transistor that boosts a tiny loudspeaker, 
            and you hear a much louder version of sound around you.
            <br><br>
            Transistors also work as switches. 
            A small electric current flowing through one part of a transistor can make a much larger current flow through the other part. 
            This is how all computer chips work. For instance, a memory chip includes hundreds 
            of transistors, each of which can be switched on or off individually. Since every transistor can be in two 
            separate states, it can store two numbers zero and one separately. 
            A chip can store billions of zeros and ones with billions of transistors and as many letters and numbers.

            <h3>Applications of Transistor</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Semi-conducting materials make the working of transistor possible. Most of you must be familiar with electrically 
            conductive and non-conductive materials. Metals are typically considered to be conductive. Things like plastics, 
            wood, ceramics, and glass are insulators, or non-conductive. A team of scientists discovered how to test certain 
            types of crystals and utilize them as electronic control devices by exploiting their semi-conductive properties.
