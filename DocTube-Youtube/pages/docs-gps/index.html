            Satellite Navigation is based on a global network of satellites that transmit radio signals from medium earth orbit. 
            Users of Satellite Navigation are most familiar with the 31 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites developed and operated by the United States. 
            Three other constellations also provide similar services. 
            Collectively, these constellations and their augmentations are called Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). 
            The other constellations are GLONASS developed and operated by the Russian Federation, Galileo developed and operated by the European Union, and BeiDou, developed and operated by China. 
            All providers have offered free use of their respective systems to the international community. 
            All providers have developed International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices to support use of these constellations for aviation.

            The basic GPS service provides users with approximately 7.0 meter accuracy, 95% of the time, anywhere on or near the surface of the earth. 
            To accomplish this, each of the 31 satellites emits signals that enable receivers through a combination of signals from at least four satellites, to determine their location and time. 
            GPS satellites carry atomic clocks that provide extremely accurate time. 
            The time information is placed in the codes broadcast by the satellite so that a receiver can continuously determine the time the signal was broadcast. 
            The signal contains data that a receiver uses to compute the locations of the satellites and to make other adjustments needed for accurate positioning. 
            The receiver uses the time difference between the time of signal reception and the broadcast time to compute the distance, or range, from the receiver to the satellite.

        <br>
        <p>
            The receiver must account for propagation delays or decreases in the signal's speed caused by the ionosphere and the troposphere. 
            With information about the ranges to three satellites and the location of the satellite when the signal was sent, the receiver can compute its own three-dimensional position. 
            An atomic clock synchronized to GPS is required in order to compute ranges from these three signals. 
            However, by taking a measurement from a fourth satellite, the receiver avoids the need for an atomic clock. 
            Thus, the receiver uses four satellites to compute latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.

        <p>With an error of only 1 second in up to 100 million years, atomic clocks are among the most accurate timekeeping devices in history.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- How it works ?</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Atomic clocks are designed to measure the precise length of a second, the base unit of modern timekeeping. 
            The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the time it takes a caesium-133 atom in a precisely defined state to oscillate exactly

        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            In an atomic clock, the natural oscillations of atoms act like the pendulum in a grandfather clock. 
            However, atomic clocks are far more precise than conventional clocks because atomic oscillations have a much higher frequency and are much more stable.
            <br>
            There are many different types of atomic clocks, but they generally share the same basic working principle, which is described below:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            - Heat, Bundle, and Sort
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First, the atoms are heated in an oven and bundled into a beam. 
            Each atom has one of two possible energy states. 
            They are referred to as hyperfine levels, but let's call them state A and state B.
            <br>
            A magnetic field then removes all atoms in state B from the beam, so only atoms in state A remain.
        </p>

            <span><i>The inner workings of Atomic clock</i></span>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            - Irridate and Count
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The state-A atoms are sent through a resonator where they are subjected to microwave radiation, which triggers some of the atoms to change to state B. 
            Behind the resonator, atoms that are still in state A are removed by a second magnetic field. 
            A detector then counts all atoms that have changed to state B.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            - Tune and Measure
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The percentage of atoms that change their state while passing through the resonator depends on the frequency of the microwave radiation. 
            The more it is in sync with the inherent oscillation frequency of the atoms, the more atoms change their state.
            <br>
            The goal is to perfectly tune the microwave frequency to the oscillation of the atoms, and then measure it. 
            After exactly 9,192,631,770 oscillations, a second has passed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="title-cont">
            How Accurate Are Atomic Clocks?
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            The accuracy of atomic clocks varies and is constantly improving. 
            With an expected error of only 1 second in about 100 million years, the NIST-F1 in Boulder, Colorado, is one of the world's most precise clocks.
            <br>
            It is called a caesium fountain clock where lasers concentrate the atoms into a cloud, cool them down, and then toss them upwards. 
            This method slows the atoms down, allowing for a longer measurement period and a more precise approximation of the natural frequency of the atoms.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            - Optical Clocks
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Scientists are currently developing a device that is even more accurate than the current atomic clocks. 
            The optical atomic clock uses light in the visible spectrum to measure atomic oscillations. 
            The resonance frequency of the light rays is about 50,000 times higher than that of microwave radiation, allowing for a more precise measurement. 
            The expected deviation of the new optical clock is 1 second in 15 billion years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="title-cont">
            Why Do We Need Atomic Clocks?
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some 400 atomic clocks around the world contribute to the calculation of International Atomic Time (TAI), 
            one of the time standards used to determine Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) 
            and local times around the world.
            <br>
            Satellite navigation systems like GPS, GLONASS, 
            and Galileo also rely on precise time measurements to calculate positions accurately.
